Internally code no longer uses the 'Hidden Organization' but expects both an id1/patientNr plus an id2/organizationId to be specified
Externally the organization id is still left out of the url when not needed
UPGRADE WARNING: Check all your (snippet) extensions to RespondentAction, TrackAction, SurveyAction and project specific versions of ShowTrackTokenSnippet and ShowSingleSurveySnippet: you may need to specify extra parameters as the menu items need to know the organization id

Login & other password forms are now easy to customize on a per project basis.
Login and authorization rules are easier to extend.
All password rules are reported on change password forms.

MailController is now called MailTemplateController.
EmailController is now called CronController (with stub for compatibility).

    $tokenLibrary->checkAnswers($data['grs_id_user'], $this->session->user_id);
New:
    $this->loader->getTracker()->processCompletedTokens($data['grs_id_user'], $this->session->user_id);

Getting the survey questions:
Old:
    $source     = Gems_Sources::getBySurveyId($this->gsu_id);

New:
    $survey = $this->loader->getTracker()->getSurvey($this->gsu_id);
    $this->data = $survey->getQuestionInformation($this->locale->getLanguage());

    $model->applyRequest($this->request);
    $model->loadFirst();
    etc...

Old:
    $this->loader->getModels()->getTokenModel('T' == $this->trackType);

    $this->loader->getToken('xxxx-xxxx')->getModel();
